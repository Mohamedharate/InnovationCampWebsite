                <h1>Challenge</h1>
                <p> Why is there that people in developed country takes teachers and the school system as a given, 
                      at the same time as a rapidly increasing number of children grows up without these conditions? 
                      We believe that every single one should have the right and possibility to get an entry to 
                      education. At the same time we also believe that every child should get the possibility to raise 
                      their voice as well as then be heard. This is unfortunate not the case in many parts of the underdeveloped 
                        country of Uganda.</p>
