        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>Our solution is a project called “Teachers on Wheels”. This is a project to help a big amount of the schools
            through out the villages in Uganda. In practise this project will consist of a varying number of teachers, 
            speaking both English and Swahili, traveling with a smaller team on a daily basis from school to school and village to 
            village. Their first priority will off course in most instances consist of teaching and helping the current
            staff at the school. Their second priority will be to collect the children’s “voices” about the current problem
            at their own school. This will be done through drawings and/or written messages from the children as well as 
            video recording where the children can speak freely. This second obstacle is in some ways the most important task 
            for “Teachers on Wheels”. Because we don’t just want to be able to help in small proportions, but we also want to 
            impact those around the world that cant see or understand the children’s situations or their needs that has 
            to be fulfilled to be able to reach the goal of a entering a decline in the percentages of illiteracy in Uganda along 
            with raising the voices of the children.</p>
